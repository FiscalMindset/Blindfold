# Blindfold — Changelog

> What shipped, when, and what changed. Format: dated sections, newest first.

---

## [0.4.4] — 2026-07-13 — Boxed, responsive command outputs

### Changed
- **`doctor` / `status` / `credit` / `sealed` / `audit`** now render in the same
  rounded, responsive boxes as `help` — consistent, width-aware, with over-long
  values safely clipped (a long sealed-key name can no longer break the border).
  Only presentation changed: the diagnostics, data, and exit codes are identical.
- `tui.ts` gains `clip()` (ANSI/emoji-aware truncation); `boxLines` clips every
  line so no content can overflow a box.

---

## [0.4.3] — 2026-07-13 — `blindfold help` you can actually learn from

### Changed
- **Every command in `blindfold help` now shows one concrete example** (green),
  so you can grasp it at a glance — e.g. `grant` shows
  `blindfold grant --host api.openai.com`. No command is example-less anymore
  (incl. `whoami`, `logout`).
- **Plain-English summaries** — rewrote the confusing ones (notably `grant`:
  "Allow the enclave to reach an API's server; do this once per API before the
  proxy can call it"). `share`/`revoke` clarified too.
- **More color / breathing room** — command names bold-cyan, examples green,
  a blank line between commands, a highlighted quick-start.

---

## [0.4.2] — 2026-07-13 — Per-command help + usage in the overview

### Added
- **Per-command help** — `blindfold <cmd> --help` (or `-h`, or `blindfold help
  <cmd>`) shows a detailed, responsive panel: a summary box, the exact **Usage**
  line, a **Flags** table (each flag + description), **Examples**, and **Notes**.
- The **overview** (`blindfold help`) now shows each command's invocation format
  inline (`↳ blindfold signup [--email <addr>] …`) under its summary.
- New `src/help.ts` command registry driving both views; `tui.ts` gains
  `boxLines` / `rule` / exported `pad`.

---

## [0.4.1] — 2026-07-12 — Responsive terminal UI for `blindfold help`

### Changed
- **`blindfold help`** is now a structured, responsive terminal UI: commands
  grouped into bordered, rounded boxes (Get started / Secrets / Proxy & serve /
  Team & sharing / Enclave & admin / Account / Agent skill) with aligned columns
  that reflow to the terminal width (emoji/CJK-aware so borders line up). A
  banner box + a published-flow quick-start replace the flat command dump.
- **Unknown commands** now print a concise error with a "did you mean …?"
  suggestion (edit-distance) instead of dumping the whole help.
- New dependency-free `src/tui.ts` (width detection, ANSI/width-aware wrapping,
  boxes, command table, nearest-match).

---

## [0.4.0] — 2026-07-12 — Self-serve onboarding + defense-in-depth + audit remediation

### Added
- **`blindfold signup`** — self-serve onboarding. On a machine with no
  credentials, `npm i -g` + `blindfold signup --email you@x.com` mints a
  brand-new Terminal 3 testnet tenant end-to-end: generates a tenant key
  locally (keychain, never printed), eth-authenticates, verifies the email by
  emailed code, and self-admits (`becomeDevTenant`) to mint welcome credits
  (~20,000 tokens on the current testnet dial). Surfaces wrong-code, expired,
  and email-already-owned distinctly. Testnet-only; one email binds to one
  tenant. *Verified live on a second (Windows) machine.*
- **Per-session proxy token** (`proxy --auth`) — only the wrapped agent can use
  the proxy (constant-time checked); **unix-domain socket** mode (`proxy --socket`,
  `0600`) so only your OS user can connect, usable by SDKs via `wrap({ socket })`.
- **Client-side TDX remote attestation** (`blindfold attest`) — verifies the
  enclave's quotes chain to Intel's SGX root CA and pins the RTMR3 code
  measurement; `attest --pin` makes `seal`/`proxy` auto-verify the enclave first.
- **`blindfold credit`** (alias `balance`) — show the tenant's Terminal 3 token
  balance + exhausted flag (a session-authed read; costs no credit, works at 0).
- **`blindfold update`** (alias `upgrade`) — refresh the global install from the
  repo source (or `@fiscalmindset/blindfold@latest`); never the unrelated bare npm
  `blindfold` package.
- **Colored CLI output** — TTY-aware ANSI (plain when piped / in CI); applied to
  help, errors, and the health commands (status/doctor/whoami/sealed/credit).

### Packaging
- Package renamed to **`@fiscalmindset/blindfold`** (command stays `blindfold`).
  The bare npm name `blindfold` is an unrelated, deprecated package, so publish
  and `npm i -g` must use the scoped name.
- **Publish-ready:** MIT `LICENSE` + `license` field, package `README.md`,
  `repository`/`homepage`/`bugs`/`keywords` metadata. Library exports (`.`,
  `./proxy`, `./register`, `./wrap`) now build to `dist/lib/*.mjs` (runnable in
  plain Node), with types resolved from the shipped `src/*.ts`.

### Security (self-audit remediation)
- **Enclave contract v0.5.6** (published, id 476): the sentinel is substituted
  **only** into `Authorization` (other headers containing it are rejected); the
  sealed secret is **redacted from the returned body** (reflection-exfil defense);
  the webhook URL must be exactly the sentinel (no host-grafting); `amz_date` is
  validated before slicing (no enclave panic). *Verified live: a header-smuggling
  attempt now returns HTTP 400.*
- Attestation gate requires a **pinned RTMR3 to seal**, refuses **mock mode** when
  attestation is required, and warns loudly on `--no-attest` / unpinned / TOFU-pin.
- `use --url` is now gated by the **egress allowlist**; the proxy token prints to
  stderr with a shared-machine warning; config writes are file-locked.
- **Chatbot:** `X-Forwarded-For` is trusted only behind a proxy flag, plus a
  **global per-window spend budget** on the paid LLM fallback; CORS allowlist;
  no error-detail leak; history validation; KB treated as untrusted data.

### Performance / scale
- Bounded concurrent enclave calls (`BLINDFOLD_MAX_INFLIGHT`, 503 when saturated);
  attestation result cached with a TTL; non-blocking usage log; chatbot KB served
  via an inverted index instead of a full per-request scan.

---

## [0.3.0] — Tenant key in the OS keychain

### Added
- `blindfold login` / `logout` / `whoami`. `login` stores the tenant key in the
  **OS keychain** (macOS `security` / Linux `secret-tool`); `config.json` keeps
  only the non-secret DID + settings.

### Security
- Closes the residual risk that a plaintext credentials file could be read by a
  prompt-injected agent — the tenant key is no longer a readable file.

## [0.2.0] — Installable, SSD-independent CLI

### Added
- Bundled CLI (`esbuild` → `dist/cli.mjs`); `npm i -g`-able, runs with plain
  `node` off the source drive.
- State + config moved to `~/.blindfold` (auto-migrated from the in-repo
  `.blindfold/`). Overridable via `BLINDFOLD_STATE_DIR`.
- Credentials via `blindfold login` (`~/.blindfold/config.json`), so the CLI
  works from any directory without a repo `.env`.

## [0.1.x] — Security/scale hardening + Discord webhook

### Added
- **Discord webhook support.** New `webhook` auth scheme in the contract
  (v0.5.5): the enclave substitutes the sealed URL *in the URL*. A `/discord`
  proxy provider + a release-path example (`examples/discord-webhook/`).
- **GitHub example** (`examples/github/`) with real, redacted runs.

### Fixed (security & scale audit)
- blindfold: HMAC-keyed tamper-evident ledger + file locking; 504 timeouts on
  enclave calls; dashboard tail + usage-log rotation; proxy body cap;
  egress-hosts lock+union; `rollback` fingerprint guard; removed the
  `readers:"all"` grant fallback; `migrate` backup written `0600`; `use --url`
  https guard.
- chatbot: KB cache fix + per-entry token index; request body cap + per-IP rate
  limit + LLM concurrency cap/timeout; `javascript:`-URI XSS guard; CORS opt-in.
- CI: removed the phantom `@blindfold/core` dependency that 404'd `npm install`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **`packages/chatbot/`** — a rule-based chatbot for the Blindfold project.
  - 481 KB entries curated from the actual docs and source code.
  - Rule-based intent classifier (regex / phrase / keyword / exact).
  - Audience detection (user / developer / founder / enterprise / researcher) with shape-based heuristics and explicit override.
  - Entity extraction (providers, file paths, CLI commands, URLs, topics).
  - Audience-aware responder with founder / enterprise / researcher tail notes.
  - Optional LLM fallback (opt-in via env) with key-shaped-token scrubbing before sending.
  - CLI modes: `repl`, `ask`, `serve`, `audit`, `stats`, `extract`.
  - Plain `http` web server (no framework) + hand-crafted UI (terminal-aesthetic).
  - **Knowledge extraction pipeline** — `bin/extract-knowledge.ts` walks `docs/` and `src/`, calls the configured model for Q&A pairs per chunk, merges into the KB by intent with confidence-weighted dedup. Cache makes re-runs idempotent.
  - KB refreshed by `npm run chatbot -- extract`. Built fresh from 487 source chunks via the configured model (`MiniMax-M3` via `samagama.in/platform/proxy/v1`).
- **`CHATBOT.md`** — full chatbot documentation.
- **`KNOWLEDGE.md`** — KB schema, contributor workflow, extraction pipeline docs.
- **`ARCHITECTURE.md`** — system-wide architecture (proxy + contract + chatbot + dashboard).
- **`SECURITY.md`** — threat model + audit invariant + chatbot-specific security notes.
- **`ROADMAP.md`** — what shipped, what's next, what's deliberately not happening.

### Changed
- **`packages/blindfold/src/register.ts`** — the canonical audit-critial file is unchanged. The invariant holds: one file, one function, one binding, out of scope.
- **`packages/blindfold/src/providers.ts`** — unchanged. The provider registry still holds 12 first-class integrations across 6 industries.

### Security
- The chatbot does not introduce new plaintext paths. The LLM fallback holds the API key in one local binding for the duration of one `fetch()`, identical to `registerSecret`. Or — better — routes through the Blindfold proxy with the sentinel, so the chatbot's process only ever sees `__BLINDFOLD__`.
- The request is scrubbed of `sk-…`, `sk_live_…`, `AKIA…`, `ghp_…` before any LLM call.
- The response is parsed with a balanced-brace JSON extractor; no `eval`.

## [Earlier]

The project history before this changelog lives in:

- [`explain.md`](explain.md) — long-form explainer with running status.
- [`current_status.md`](current_status.md) — the living status file.
- [`docs/03-architecture.md`](docs/03-architecture.md) — the original architecture doc.
- Git history.

Highlights of what shipped before this release:

- TDX + Rust + WASM contract with in-enclave substitution.
- TS SDK + CLI with `register` / `use` / `proxy` / `publish` / `doctor` / `verify` / `migrate` / `rotate` / `rollback` / `grant` / `init` / `dashboard` / `compat` / `export`.
- 12 first-class providers across 6 industries: OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI/Grok, Groq, Gemini, Stripe, GitHub, SendGrid, Slack, Twilio, AWS SES, AWS S3.
- Three in-enclave auth schemes: bearer, basic (Twilio), sigv4 (AWS).
- Side-by-side attack demo (`demo/`).
- Mock mode (`BLINDFOLD_MOCK=1`) for CI and onboarding.
- Live proof: `scripts/test-enclave-egress.ts` demonstrates a real GitHub call made from inside the TDX enclave, with the plaintext token never crossing the boundary.
- Runnable examples in `examples/` for every supported provider.
